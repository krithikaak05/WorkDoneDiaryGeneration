The program operates as follows:

1. Credential Validation: Teachers log in by validating their credentials. This ensures secure access to the system.
2.  Work Diary Generation: Upon successful login, teachers can generate their work diaries, providing a detailed record of planned tasks and responsibilities. The diary includes information such as class schedules, subjects to be taught, and any additional responsibilities.
3. Task/Work Completion: Teachers can update their work diaries in real-time as tasks are completed. This provides an accurate reflection of daily accomplishments and aids in tracking progress.

<b> Further use cases are work in progress: <b>
1. Leave Management: The system includes functionality for teachers to request and manage leaves. If a teacher is on leave, the work diary is automatically adjusted to reflect the absence, ensuring accurate records.
2. Substitute Teacher Assignments: In cases of teacher absence, the system facilitates the assignment of substitute teachers. The substitute's details and tasks are seamlessly integrated into the work diary.

Contributions are welcome to further enhance the functionality and usability of the Teacher Work Diary Generation System. Let's work together to make this project a valuable tool for educators!
